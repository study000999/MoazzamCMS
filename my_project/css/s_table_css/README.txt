 Responstable is a CSS solution for responsive tables. It uses the HTML5 attribute <strong>data-th</strong> and the pseudo <strong>:after</strong> to create a alternate column header when in mobile view. Because it is designed mobile first you will need the respond.js (https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) to make it work with IE8 (and below).
